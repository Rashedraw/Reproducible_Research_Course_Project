# Reproducible_Research_Course_Project

## This repository has been created for the Course Project 1 of the Reproducible Research Course from the Data Science Specialization Package on Courseara.

The repository consists of 1) an Rmd file which contains the code and any necessary comments to explain the questions that were answered, 
                       and 2) an HTML file of the code, figures, and comments.
